# SpanishSignLanguage
This GitHub repository hosts the code used to develop a classification system for Spanish Sign Language as part of my master's thesis. You can find the code in the "codes" folder. I hope it proves helpful. For licensing details, please refer to [LICENSE.md.](https://github.com/PamDiazSerrano/SpanishSignLanguage/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

The dataset used for training consists of static sign images available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OWQDVGopTvnfoHP8X8CyU9r_sIdxIPCS?usp=share_link
There are two folders: one with images sized 192x192 and another with images sized 512x512.
